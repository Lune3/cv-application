The CV generator consists of two main sections: the input and the visualization sections. In the control section, the user can input, edit and delete their information. The information inputted in the control section will be available in real-time in the visualization section. When finished, the user can then download their CV properly formatted in PDF. This project was made using React JS. </p>
